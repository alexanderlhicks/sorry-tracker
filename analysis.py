    "This theorem states that for any two natural numbers `a` and `b`, if both `a` and `b` are even, then their sum `a + b` is also even.\n\n"
    "### Context\n"
    "This is a fundamental property of even numbers and relies on the definition `is_even` provided in the same file. It's a basic building block for number theory proofs.\n\n"
    "### Proof Suggestion\n"
    "1.  Start by using the `unfold is_even` tactic to expand the definition of `is_even` in the hypotheses `ha` and `hb` and the goal.\n"
    "2.  This will give you two witnesses, let's say `k_a` and `k_b`, such that `a = 2 * k_a` and `b = 2 * k_b`.\n"
    "3.  Substitute these equations into the goal `is_even (a + b)`.\n"
    "4.  The goal will become `∃ k, 2 * k_a + 2 * k_b = 2 * k`.\n"
    "5.  Use the `ring` tactic or factor out the 2 to show that you can provide `k_a + k_b` as the witness for the existential quantifier.\n"
