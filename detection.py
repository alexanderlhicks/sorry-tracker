"""Detection of Lean `sorry`/`admit` proof obligations.

Walks a Lean source tree and yields one :class:`Sorry` per declaration that
contains an incompleteness marker. Detection is comment- and string-aware (via
:func:`lean_utils.scrub_line`), so a marker inside a comment or a string literal
is never reported, and ``sorryAx`` / primed identifiers like ``sorry'`` are not
mistaken for the keyword. Each obligation carries a stable id used for
cross-run duplicate detection.
